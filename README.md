# Drum Kit üéµü•Å

Welcome to the Drum Kit project! This is a fun and interactive virtual drum kit built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can play various drum sounds by clicking on the buttons or pressing corresponding keys on keyboard.

## Features
- Interactive buttons for each drum sound.
- Corresponding keypress functionality (w, a, s, d, j, k, l).
- Animated button press effect.
- Visual design with background images for each drum.

## How It Works
The Drum Kit consists of a simple HTML structure with buttons that correspond to different drum sounds. When you click a button or press a key, the corresponding sound plays, and the button shows a visual animation of being pressed.

### Key Features:
- **HTML**: The buttons for each drum sound are created in HTML, each associated with a keypress.
- **CSS**: The design uses CSS for styling the buttons and background. There's a visual animation when a button is pressed.
- **JavaScript**: The main functionality is written in JavaScript. It handles:
  - Playing the corresponding sound when a button is clicked.
  - Playing the sound when a specific key is pressed.
  - Adding animation to buttons when pressed.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary sound files in the `sounds/` folder and image files in the `images/` folder.
3. Open `drum.html` in your browser to start playing!

## Usage
- Click the buttons on the screen to play sounds.
- Press the corresponding keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) to play the sounds.
- Each button shows a brief animation when pressed.
